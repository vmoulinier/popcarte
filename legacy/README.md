## 🚀 About

**LibreBooking** is an open-source resource scheduling solution. It provides a
flexible, mobile-friendly, and extensible interface for organizations to manage
resource reservations.

The repository for LibreBooking is hosted on GitHub at
<https://github.com/LibreBooking/app>; the `develop` branch contains the latest
code.

LibreBooking is a fork of Booked Scheduler, based on Booked Scheduler's last
open-source version released in 2020. Since then, LibreBooking has evolved
significantly and diverged from the original project.

## ✨ Features

- [x] Multi-resource booking & waitlists
- [x] DataTables for advanced listings
- [x] Role-based access control
- [x] Quotas and credits for reservations
- [x] Granular usage reporting
- [x] Responsive Bootstrap 5 interface
- [x] Custom themes and color schemes
- [x] Plugin-ready architecture
- [x] Outlook/Thunderbird integration through ics
