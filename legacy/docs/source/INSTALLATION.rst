LibreBooking Installation
=========================

.. note::
   For users without web hosting service or existing environment, packages like
   `XAMMP <http://www.apachefriends.org/en/index.html>`__ or `WampServer
   <http://www.wampserver.com/en/>`__ can help you get set up quickly.

Fresh Installation
------------------

Server Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In an **Apache** or similar server environment, some required modules
for LibreBooking may not be enabled by default. The following modules
(or their equivalents) are often not enabled as part of a standard
installation but should be enabled for the proper operation of the
LibreBooking application:

-  headers
-  rewrite

The enabled modules in an **Apache2** environment can be verified as
follows:

.. code:: bash

   apachectl -M

If required modules are not present in the enabled list, modules can be
enabled in an **Apache2** environment as follows:

.. code:: bash

   sudo a2enmod headers
   sudo a2enmod rewrite
   sudo service apache2 restart

Application Deployment to Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Move the contents of the directory to your webserver’s document root (or
subsite). If you don’t have direct access to your document root or use a
hosting service, then transfer the directory to your web server’s
document root using FTP or `WinSCP <https://winscp.net/>`__.
Alternatively, you can clone the application directly from the official GitHub repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/LibreBooking/app.git

After copying or cloning the application to your web server:

Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd app
       composer install

Copy ``/config/config.dist.php`` to ``/config/config.php`` and adjust
the settings for your environment.

Important! The web server must have write access (0755) to
``/librebooking/tpl_c`` and ``/librebooking/tpl`` `want to know
why? <http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/variable.compile.dir.tpl>`__

If using an (S)FTP client, check read/write/execute for Owner and Group
on ``/tpl``, ``/tpl_c``, and ``/uploads``

LibreBooking will not work if PHP
`session.autostart <http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.auto-start>`__
is enabled. Ensure this setting is disabled.

Application Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure LibreBooking to fit your environments and needs or use the
minimal default settings which should be enough for the application to work. We
recommend you to change according to your specifics. Additional information on
all configuration settings can be found in the application help page. To
configure the application, you can open ``/config/config.php`` and alter any
settings accordingly.

The admin email address can be set in the ``librebooking/config/config.php``
file of ``$conf['settings']['admin.email']``

When later register an account with admin email address the user will be given
admin privilege.

In addition, to allow resource image uploads, the web server must also have
read/write access to your configurable uploads directory of
``$conf['settings']['image.upload.directory']`` in the ``config.php``.

By default, LibreBooking uses standard username/password for user
authentication.

Alternatively, you can use LDAP authentication. See the plugins section of the
application help page for more details.

.. note::
   If you try to load the application at this time (eg.
   http://localhost/librebooking/Web/), you will probably get a white page.

This is because there is no backend database configured yet. So continue on …

Database Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Edit the configuration file to set up the database connection.

Open the configuration file (located at `config/config.php`) and ensure the following database settings are properly filled out:

.. code-block:: php

    $conf['settings']['database']['type'] = 'mysql';
    $conf['settings']['database']['user'] = 'lb_user';         // Database user with permission to access the LibreBooking database
    $conf['settings']['database']['password'] = 'password';    // Database password
    $conf['settings']['database']['hostspec'] = '127.0.0.1';   // IP address, DNS name, or named pipe
    $conf['settings']['database']['name'] = 'librebooking';    // Name of the database used by LibreBooking

Ensure that the database user has the necessary privileges to create the database (if it does not exist), and to create, read, insert, update, and modify tables within it.

You have 2 ways to set up your database for the application to work.

Automatic Database Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You must have the application configured correctly before running the
automated install.

| The automated database setup only supports MySQL at this time.
| To run the automated database setup, make sure to first set an installation password in the configuration file:

.. code-block:: php

    $conf['settings']['install.password'] = 'your_secure_password';

This password is required to access the installer.

Then, navigate to the ``/Web/install`` directory in a web browser and follow
the on-screen instructions.

.. note::
   Some may see directory permission issues displayed on the page.
   The web server must have write access to ``/librebooking/tpl_c`` and
   ``/librebooking/tpl``.
   If you cannot provide the required permission. Contact your web server
   administrator or hosting service to resolve or run the manual install

Manual Database Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| The packaged database scripts make assumptions about your desired
  database configuration and set default values.
| Please edit them to suit your environment before running. The files
  are located in ``librebooking/database_schema/``
| Import the following sql files in the listed order (we recommend
  `phpMyAdmin <https://www.phpmyadmin.net/>`__)

| On a remote host with no database creation privileges
| If you are installing LibreBooking on a remote host, please follow
  these steps.
| These steps assume you are using cPanel and have the ability to create
  databases via the cPanel tool and phpMyAdmin.

Adding the database and user

Select the MySQL Databases tool

Add a new user with username and password of your choice. This will be
the database user and database password set in your LibreBooking config
file.

**Please be aware that some hosts will prefix your database user name.**

| Create a new database with whatever name you choose.
| This will be the name of the database in your LibreBooking config
  file. ‘librebooking’ is the recommended database name.

**Please be aware that some hosts will prefix your database name.**

| Associate the new user with the new database, giving the user
  permission to SELECT, CREATE, UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE.
| Click the ‘Add User to Db’ button. ‘Creating tables’
| Open phpMyAdmin.
| Click on the database name that you just created in the left panel.
| Click the SQL tab at the top of the page.
| Import ``/database_schema/create-schema.sql`` to librebooking (or
  whatever database name was used in the creation process)
| Import ``/database_schema/create-data.sql`` to librebooking (or
  whatever database name was used in the creation process)

| If you have database creation privileges in MySQL
| Open ``/database_schema/full-install.sql`` and edit the database name
  and username/password to match your ``config.php`` database values
| Run or import ``/database_schema/full-install.sql`` Optionally -
  run/import ``/database_schema/testdata-utf8.sql`` to librebooking
  (sample application data will be created with 2 users: admin/password
  and user/password).
| These users are available for testing your installation.

You are done. Try to load the application at (eg.
http://yourhostname/librebooking/Web/).

Registering the Administrator Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the database has been set up you will need to register the account
for your application administrator. Navigate to register.php register an
account with email address set in ``$conf['settings']['admin.email']``.

Upgrading
---------

Upgrading from a previous version of LibreBooking (or Booked 2.x and phpScheduleIt 2.x)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The steps for upgrading from a previous version of LibreBooking are very
similar to the steps described above in Application Deployment to
Server.

Recommended
^^^^^^^^^^^

| The recommended approach is to backup your current LibreBooking files,
  then upload the new files to the that same location.
| This prevents any old files from interfering with new ones. After the
  new files are uploaded, copy your old ``config/config.php`` file to
  the config directory in the new version.
| Then run ``/Web/install/configure.php`` to bring your config file up
  to date.
| If you have any uploaded resource images you will need to copy them
  from their old location to the new one.

Alternative
^^^^^^^^^^^

| An alternative upgrade approach is to overwrite the current
  LibreBooking files with the new ones.
| If doing this, you must delete the contents of ``/tpl_c``. This
  approach will not allow you to roll back and will not clear out any
  obsolete files.

Database
^^^^^^^^

After the application files have been upgraded you will need to upgrade
the database.

Automatical Database Upgrade
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

| The automatic database upgrade is exactly the same as the automatic
  database install.
| Please follow the instructions in the Automatic Database Setup section
  above.

Manual Database Upgrade
'''''''''''''''''''''''

| The packaged database scripts make assumptions about your desired
  database configuration and set default values. Please edit them to
  suit your environment before running. The files are located in
  ``librebooking/database_schema/upgrades.`` Depending on your current
  version, import the ``upgrade.sql`` file within each subdirectory to
  get to the current version (we recommend
  `adminer <https://www.adminer.org/>`__ for this)
| For example, if you are running version 2.0 and the current version is
  2.2 then you should run
  ``librebooking/database_schema/upgrade/2.1/upgrade.sql`` then
  ``librebooking/database_schema/upgrade/2.2/upgrade.sql``

Migrating from version 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| A migration from 1.2 to 2.0 is supported for MySQL only.
| This can be run after the 2.0 installation.
| To run the migration open ``/Web/install/migrate.php`` directory in a
  web browser and follow the on-screen instructions.

Getting Started
---------------

The First Login
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 2 main types of accounts, they are admin and user account.

-  If you imported a sample application data, you now can use
   admin/password and user/password to login and make changes or
   addition via the application.
-  If not, **you will need to register an account with your configured
   admin email address**. The admin email address can be set in the
   ``librebooking/config/config.php`` file of setting
   ``$conf['settings']['admin.email']``

Other self registration accounts are defaulted to normal users.

After registration you will be logged in automatically.

At this time, it is recommended to change your password.

-  For LDAP authentication please login with your LDAP
   username/password.

Log Files
^^^^^^^^^

LibreBooking logs multiple levels of information categorized into either
application or database logs. To do this:

-  To allow application logging, the PHP account requires write access
   (0755) to your configured log directory.
-  Logging is configured in /config/config.php
-  Levels used by LibreBooking are OFF, DEBUG, ERROR. For normal
   operation, ERROR is appropriate. If trace logs are needed, DEBUG is
   appropriate.
-  To turn on application logging, change the
   ``$conf['settings']['logging']['level'] =`` to an appropriate level
   for either the default or sql loggers. For example,
   ``$conf['settings']['logging']['level'] = 'debug';``

Enabling LibreBooking API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LibreBooking has the option to expose a RESTful JSON API. This API can
be leveraged for third party integration, automation or to develop
client applications.

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  PHP 8.2 or greater
-  To use ‘friendly’ URLs, mod_rewrite or URL rewriting must be enabled
-  Your web server must accept all verbs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Set ``$conf['settings']['api']['enabled'] = 'true'``; in your config
   file.
-  If you want friendly URL paths, mod_rewrite or URL rewriting must be
   enabled. Note, this is not required in order to use the API.
-  If using mod_rewrite and an Apache alias, ensure RewriteBase in
   /Web/Services/.htaccess is set to that alias root.

API Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Auto-generated documentation for API usage can be found by browsing
http://your_librebooking_url/Web/Services.

API documentation is also available at :doc:`API`

This documentation describes each available service, indicates whether or not
the service is available to unauthenticated users/administrators, and provides
example requests/responses.

Consuming the API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If URL rewriting is being used, all services will be available from
http://your_librebooking_url/Web/Services If not using URL rewriting,
all services will be available from
http://your_librebooking_url/Web/Services/index.php

Certain services are only available to authenticated users or
administrators. Secure services will require a session token and userid,
which can be obtained from the Authentication service.
